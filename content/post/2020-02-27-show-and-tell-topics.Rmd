We had a "show and tell" session, topics:

- Rstudio::conf happened, their talks are online. Nichole recommended [Styling Shiny apps with Sass and Bootstrap 4 - Joe Cheng](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/styling-shiny-apps-with-sass-and-bootstrap-4-joe-cheng), [Reproducible Shiny apps with shinymeta - Dr. Carson Sievert](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/reproducible-shiny-apps-with-shinymeta-dr-carson-sievert), and [Technical Debt is a Social Problem - Gordon Shotwell](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/technical-debt-is-a-social-problem-gordon-shotwell-2)
- How to write Excel files with `writexl` (link to Derek's GitHub repo for the [R markdown](https://github.com/dnedveck/madrug-xrcise/blob/master/2020-02-27_xRcise_saving-to-excel-worksheets.Rmd) and [html](https://github.com/dnedveck/madrug-xrcise/blob/master/2020-02-27_xRcise_saving-to-excel-worksheets.html)). Also if you're keen on working with the styling of Excel sheets, try `openxlsx`
